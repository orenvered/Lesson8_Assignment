What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.

A CDN is a tool that allows a user to distribute files and load across several different systems instead of hosting a website on a single server.

Four advantages are:

1) Different domains

Browsers limit the number of file downloads to a single domain

2) High capacity infrastructures

Higher availablilty, lower network latency and lower packet loss

3) Distributed data centers

CDN's provide localized data centers which are closer to the user and result in faster downloads

4) Built-in version control

Possible to link to a specific version of a CSS file or JavaScript library, and can also request the latest version if required
